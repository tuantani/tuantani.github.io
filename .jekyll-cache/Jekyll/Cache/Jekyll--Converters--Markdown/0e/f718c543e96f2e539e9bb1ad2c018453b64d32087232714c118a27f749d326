I"ê<p>The value of Australian horticultural exports grew rapidly in the 20 years to 2018‚Äì19, increasing by nearly 3% per year on average to $3.4 billion (ABS 2020). In that year Australia exported horticultural products to over 30 countries, 14 of which were in Asia. Strong Asian demand growth for high quality, fresh fruit and vegetables and Australia‚Äôs increasing international competitiveness in recent years underpinned this export growth. This competitiveness has been supported by the development of export-oriented horticultural industries and ongoing reform to industry-specific regulation (Xia &amp; Nelson 2018). But other factors, such as exchange rates, food safety concerns, supply chain efficiencies and market access, have also been key drivers.</p>

<p>This report focusses on one important issue for Australia‚Äôs horticultural industry: market access. Australia‚Äôs market access for horticultural exports has been enhanced through successful negotiations with partner countries. The terms of the agreements have typically included a combination of agreed tariff reductions and protocols that set out the conditions that govern how a country‚Äôs product may enter a given market. Notwithstanding the potential additional cost incurred by exporters to comply with these conditions, the protocols have allowed Australian producers to export a broader range of products to more markets.</p>

<p>Around 70% of Australian agricultural production is exported. Because of this export dependence, maintaining or improving access to overseas markets is essential for the sustainability and profitability of the Australian agricultural sector. Improvements to market access support the competitiveness of the industry and can be achieved through lower tariffs or clearer, less restrictive or less costly protocols for exporters.</p>

<p>This article uses a case study to analyse the impact of market access improvements on Australian stone fruit exports. The study illustrates how the removal of an impediment to trade provided a pathway for the cherry and summerfruit (apricots, nectarines, peaches and plums) industries to successfully compete in a large and growing market.</p>
