I"¦<p>President Joko â€œJokowiâ€ Widodo said the fruit consumption rate of people in Indonesia remained low at 88.5 grams per person daily despite the easy availability and affordability of various indigenous fruits in the country.</p>

<p>â€œIt is still well below the WHO recommendation at 150 grams per person daily,â€ said Jokowi when opening the Archipelago Fruit Exhibition on Monday, August 9, 2021.</p>

<p>Jokowi thus called on Indonesians to consume more fruits, particularly amid the pandemic, during which it was vital to people to safeguard their stamina and increase their body immunity.</p>

<p>Jokowi said this was attainable by, among others, consuming more fruits and vegetables. He also called on people to love the nationâ€™s diverse collection of indigenous fruits, â€œwhich bear competitive nutrition compared to imported fruits.â€</p>

<p>Jokowi also expressed hopes that Indonesiaâ€™s indigenous fruits could be triumphant in the international market. â€œThe potential of export markets is still wide open, the odds are promising,â€ he explained.</p>

<p>Jokowi said Indonesia had exported mangoes, pineapples, bananas and mangosteens to various countries, and that he hoped more Indonesian fruits could follow suit. â€œSo that people around the globe will also love Indonesian fruits,â€ Jokowi said.</p>
