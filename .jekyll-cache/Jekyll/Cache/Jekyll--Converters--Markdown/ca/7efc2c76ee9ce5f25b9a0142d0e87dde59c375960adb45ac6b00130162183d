I"ÿ<p>The value of Australian horticultural exports grew rapidly in the 20 years to 2018â€“19, increasing by nearly 3% per year on average to $3.4 billion (ABS 2020). In that year Australia exported horticultural products to over 30 countries, 14 of which were in Asia. Strong Asian demand growth for high quality, fresh fruit and vegetables and Australiaâ€™s increasing international competitiveness in recent years underpinned this export growth. This competitiveness has been supported by the development of export-oriented horticultural industries and ongoing reform to industry-specific regulation (Xia &amp; Nelson 2018). But other factors, such as exchange rates, food safety concerns, supply chain efficiencies and market access, have also been key drivers.</p>
